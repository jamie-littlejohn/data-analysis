### Data Analyst | Developer

I'm an ever-learning data analyst and developer offering user-friendly solutions to 
everyone's favourite data questions - "What does this mean?" and "How do we use 
it?". I have over seven years experience in data storytelling, forecasting and data 
migration projects having worked for a number of large companies across the UK 
innovating critical business data processes.

I specialise in SQL/Python development with a solid background in delivering 
actionable intelligence and business value with Excel and Power BI too.
